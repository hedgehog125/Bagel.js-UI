Optional element ids.
Improve onclick.

Check animation in animateSubmenuChange but allow skipping checking
Fade effect option for hover text

Clean up textures created once the menuSprite is deleted
Update Bagel.js to make hidden canvases unload and use a blank texture to start with. Or just reserve it somehow?

Set pluginProxy when making sprites

= Tweaks =
Move elements to submenus.<>.elements

Take sound assets from Bagel.js to reduce file size. (should they be loaded by default? Or the data urls could be stored in the internal plugin so they can be accessed)

Tidy up by using sub functions

Preload based on submenu?

Add in state to run for animation sprites

= Bugs =
Plain error when no submenus

animateSubmenuChange doesn't set defaults

The submenus to switch to for buttons aren't checked to see if they are valid

triangleScroll can be too short when vertical
Prevent scrolling when animation is active

Changing submenu manually doesn't delete old elements

Prepare icons during loading screen
Loading new animations and element types. Don't forget checks

Optimise texture usage by sharing the black circles. Need to prevent deletion when the canvas sprite that created it is deleted. Maybe load texture manually and use normal sprites? Copy canvas mode? How should copy canvas mode handle deleting the original sprite?
Optimise by sharing textures when the colors are the same

Should be a minimum amount of movement for touch scrolling
